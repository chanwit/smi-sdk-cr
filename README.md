# smi-sdk-cr

This is an implementation of the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) specification in the Crystal language.

It is a direct port from the Go SDK counter part.
We aim to use it to develop a CLI for our Serverless Service Mesh implementation. The first implementation uses Gloo as the API Gateway.
